# pyaiPrompt:<br>Efficient Programming in Any Language

pyaiPrompt is designed to enhance your creativity and improve your productivity. With an automatic prompt engineering-focused backend, pyaiPrompt debugs, cleans, and formats your code.

The goal of this project is to make programming easier and more enjoyable for developers at all levels. It is inspired by the idea that coding should not be a tedious or frustrating process, but a creative and enjoyable one.
<br><br>

## User-Friendly Interface

pyaiPrompt is a web application with three main parts: a code editor, a context box, and an output box. You can write code in any language in the code editor and use the context box to describe what you want your code to do. When you click the Prompt/Debug button, a prompt-formatted message will be sent to the AI. The output box will then show the new code that the AI generated, along with comments that explain how it works.

You can change the size of the three boxes to fit your needs. You can drag the lines between the boxes to change their height or double-click on any box to make it fill the screen. The code editor and output box both use CodeMirror, which is a text editor that can highlight syntax, complete words automatically, and wrap lines.

pyaiPrompt leverages Bing AI to generate outputs. pyaiPrompt then formats the text from Bing AI so that only the relevant code appears in the output.
